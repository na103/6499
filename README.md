# Celint 6499 modem
This repository contains a reverse engineered schematic for the 6499, a modem made by Celint for Commodore in Italy.<br>
It was able to connect the Commodore 64 with Sip Videotel/prestel in V.23 1200/75  and compatible V.21 300/300 on BBSs in scroll mode.<br>
inside the 27c256 there is the software necessary for the connection that starts automatically when the c64 is switched on with the cartridge inserted.<br>
note: Sip is the name of old Telephone company in Italy now TIM<br>
